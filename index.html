Brief Description of Goal of Code:
To practice and learn how to capture various images and display them onto my canvas through buttons.
 
Known Issues:
There are no known issues, but I have to create a canvas with a border surrounding it that fits on a phone screen, and then make a total of four buttons. The first button will draw a rectangle on my canvas, the second button will put my name on the canvas, and the third button will load an image onto the canvas, and the final button will clear the canvas page.
